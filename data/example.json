Aim to find the difference in efficacy and safety between tirilizumab combined with concurrent chemoradiation and standard concurrent chemoradiation.\n\nConcurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment for elderly esophageal cancer. Tirelizumab is the first-line and second-line standard treatment for advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma. However, the effect of tirilizumab combined with concurrent chemoradiation for elder with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is unkown.\n\nIn the study, the investigators plan to enroll 136 elderly subjects with locally advanced esophageal cancer from five hospitals in China. The enrolled patients will be randomly divided into two groups: tirilizumab combined with concurrent chemoradiation group (Tislelizumab + radiotherapy + tigio) and concurrent chemoradiation group (radiotherapy + tigio). The treatment efficiency and safety will be evaluated.",
