### Common Eligibility Criteria for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Trials

The common eligibility criteria for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy trials are:

Based on the analysis of the clinical trials data for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), here are the common eligibility criteria:

1. **Common Inclusion Criteria:**
   - **Gender and Age:** Predominantly male participants, with age ranges typically from 1 month to 18 years, though some studies include older participants up to 55 years.
   - **Diagnosis:** Confirmed diagnosis of DMD through genetic testing, often specifying mutations amenable to exon skipping (e.g., exons 44, 50, 51).
   - **Functional Status:** Ability to perform specific motor tasks, such as walking independently or completing the Time to Stand Test (TTSTAND) within a certain time.
   - **Stable Medication Use:** Stable dose of corticosteroids for a specified period (usually 3 to 12 months) prior to study entry.
   - **Cardiac Function:** Adequate cardiac function, often defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds (e.g., ≥40% or ≥45%).

2. **Common Exclusion Criteria:**
   - **Infections and Comorbidities:** Active viral infections, significant comorbidities such as cardiomyopathy, or other clinically significant illnesses.
   - **Previous Treatments:** Prior treatment with gene therapy, exon-skipping therapies, or investigational drugs within a specified timeframe before the study.
   - **Laboratory Abnormalities:** Abnormal laboratory values, such as elevated liver enzymes or impaired renal function.
   - **Respiratory Function:** Severe respiratory impairment, often defined by forced vital capacity (FVC) thresholds (e.g., <40%).
   - **Surgical History:** Recent major surgery or planned surgery that could interfere with study participation.

3. **Age Ranges Typically Studied:**
   - Most studies focus on children and adolescents, with common age ranges from 4 to 18 years. Some studies include infants as young as 1 month and adults up to 55 years.

4. **Biomarker or Diagnostic Requirements:**
   - Genetic confirmation of DMD, often specifying mutations amenable to exon skipping.
   - Cardiac assessments such as echocardiograms to evaluate LVEF.
   - Muscle function tests like the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) or TTSTAND.

5. **Treatment History Requirements:**
   - Stable use of corticosteroids for a specified period before study entry.
   - Exclusion of participants who have received gene therapy or other investigational treatments within a certain timeframe prior to the study.

These criteria are designed to ensure participant safety and the integrity of the study results by selecting a relatively homogeneous study population.
