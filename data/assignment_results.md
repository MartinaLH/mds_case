### Common Eligibility Criteria for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Trials

The common eligibility criteria for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy trials are:

Based on the clinical trial data provided for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), here is an analysis of common eligibility criteria:

1. **Common Inclusion Criteria:**
   - **Gender and Age:** Most trials require male participants, with age ranges typically starting from as young as 1 month to 18 years, depending on the specific study cohort.
   - **Diagnosis Confirmation:** A confirmed diagnosis of DMD through genetic testing is essential. This often includes specific mutations in the dystrophin gene, such as those amenable to exon skipping.
   - **Functional Ability:** Participants often need to demonstrate specific motor abilities, such as the ability to walk independently or perform certain motor tests like the Time to Stand Test (TTSTAND) or 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT).
   - **Stable Medication Regimen:** Many trials require participants to be on a stable dose of corticosteroids for a specified period (e.g., 12 weeks) before the study begins.

2. **Common Exclusion Criteria:**
   - **Infections and Comorbidities:** Active infections (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis B/C) or significant comorbid conditions (e.g., severe cardiomyopathy, uncontrolled diabetes) are common exclusion factors.
   - **Previous Treatments:** Prior treatment with gene therapy, exon-skipping drugs, or investigational drugs within a certain timeframe before the study often leads to exclusion.
   - **Laboratory Abnormalities:** Clinically significant abnormal lab values, such as elevated liver enzymes or impaired renal function, can exclude participants.
   - **Respiratory and Cardiac Function:** Poor respiratory function (e.g., FVC < 35%) or cardiac function (e.g., LVEF < 40%) are typical exclusion criteria.

3. **Age Ranges Typically Studied:**
   - Trials often focus on children and adolescents, with age ranges from as young as 1 month to 18 years. Some studies include adults up to 55 years, particularly for non-ambulatory cohorts or specific interventions.

4. **Biomarker or Diagnostic Requirements:**
   - Genetic testing to confirm DMD diagnosis is a standard requirement. This includes identifying specific mutations in the dystrophin gene.
   - Some trials require specific cardiac or respiratory function tests, such as echocardiograms or spirometry, to assess eligibility.

5. **Treatment History Requirements:**
   - Participants are often required to have been on a stable dose of corticosteroids for a certain period before the study.
   - Exclusion of participants who have received certain treatments, such as gene therapy or exon-skipping drugs, within a specified timeframe before the study.

These criteria ensure that participants are suitable for the specific interventions being tested and help maintain the safety and integrity of the clinical trials.
